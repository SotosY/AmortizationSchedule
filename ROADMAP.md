# Improvements and Additions

1. **Add Javadoc**: Ensure all classes are well-documented with Javadoc comments. Something like the AmortizationServiceImpl class.

2. **Add input validation**: Implement thorough validation for better security, restrict the user to enter invalid data, and return appropriate messages. The create() endpoint needs refactoring for these.

3. **Code Separation**: Improve code modularity by organizing large sections into smaller. The listAllAmortizationSchedulesDetails() and calculateAmortizationSchedule() methods definitely need improving.

4. **Test Coverage Expansion**: Increase unit test coverage to include all possible scenarios.

5. **Model Naming Refinement**: Review and refine model names. I would refactor the naming of all the models to something more clear.

6. **Refactor Logic**: Refactor logic to save any BigDecimal value to the database with precision beyond two decimals, to improve accuracy.

7. **Detailed Documentation**: Provide more comprehensive documentation.

8. **Logging Integration**: Implement logging throughout the codebase.
